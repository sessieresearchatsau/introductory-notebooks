# Introductory Notebooks
A catalog of introductory notebooks for newcomers to the Sessie Research Group. This is hosted with GitHub Pages.

To add new notebooks (and the associated PDF), simply open the `index.html`, copy the commented-out code under `<!-- Sample Row (copy, paste and modify) -->` to a position in the list of entries, change the paths to the new `.pdf/.nb` files located in the `notebooks` subdirectory, save, and push changes.
